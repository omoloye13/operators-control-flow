<!-- Examples of Arithmetic operators -->

let a = 20;
let b = 6;
let c = a+b;

let w=50;
let u = 25;
let z = w / u

<!-- Examples of Assignment Operators -->

let x = 20;
x+=5;

<!-- x = 15 -->

let y = 50;
y-=20;

<!-- y = 30 -->
<!-- Examples of comparison Operators -->
<!-- exp1: -->

let a = 5
let b = "5"
let c = a==b;

<!-- exp2: -->

let a = 5;
let b = "5";
let c = a === b;

<!-- Examples of logical operators -->

let x = 6;
let y = 3;
let z = !(x === y);

let x = 6;
let y = 3;
let z = (x === y);

<!-- Examples of bitwise operators -->

let x = 100;
x &= 5;

let x = 100;
x |= 5;
